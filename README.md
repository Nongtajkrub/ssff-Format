# ClassRoomBadWordPunishmentDB ℹ️

* The purpose of this project is to create a database management system to store information about my classmates, specifically their scores for bad language punishments.
* The system is written in C and uses a custom file format for storing the database. It can read and write data to and from the database.

## FileFormat 📁

```
name:
    soft_punishment: 0,
    hard_punishment: 0;
```

## TODO 🥅

* Implement a type system for my custom file format.
